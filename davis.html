<h3>1905-1987</h3>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Frank Marshall Davis was an American journalist, poet, political and labor movement activist, and businessman.
Davis was born in Arkansas City, Kansas, in 1905. His parents divorced, and Davis grew up living with his mother and stepfather and with his grandparents.
 In 1923, at age 17, Davis attended Friends University.
From 1924 to 1927, and again in 1929, he attended Kansas State Agricultural College, now Kansas State University.
When Davis entered Kansas State, there were twenty-five other African-American students enrolled there. He studied industrial journalism. 
He began to write poems as the result of a class assignment, and was encouraged to continue writing poetry by an English literature instructor. 
Davis pledged Phi Beta Sigma fraternity in 1925. He left college without getting a degree.
In 1927 Davis moved to Chicago, where he worked variously for the Chicago Evening Bulletin, the Chicago Whip, and the Gary American, all African-American newspapers.
 He also wrote free-lance articles and short stories for African-American magazines. It was also during this time that Davis began a serious effort to write poetry, including his first long poem, entitled Chicago's Congo, Sonata for an Orchestra.
In 1931 Davis moved to Atlanta to become an editor of a twice-weekly paper. Later that year he became the paper's managing editor. In 1932 the paper, renamed the Atlanta Daily World became the nation's first successful black daily newspaper. 
Davis continued to write and publish poems, which came to the attention of Chicago socialite Frances Norton Manning. She introduced him to Norman Forgue, the publisher of Black Cat Press. In the summer of 1935, Forgue brought out Davis's first book, Black Man's Verse.
In 1935, Davis moved back to Chicago to take the position of managing editor of the Associated Negro Press, a news service for black newspapers, which had begun in 1919. Eventually, Davis became executive editor for the ANP. He held the position until 1947.
 While in Chicago, Davis also started a photography club, worked for numerous political parties, and participated in the League of American Writers. 
 Davis was an avid photographer, and inspired Richard Wright's interest in the hobby. 
Davis's wrote that his photography consisted in large part of nudes because "the female body fascinates me, both aesthetically and emotionally" and that when photographing, he focused on "contours" and the "wide range of tones".
Davis, Richard Wright, Margaret Walker, and others were part of the South Side Writers Group, which met regularly beginning in 1936 to critique each other's work. Davis worked as a sports reporter, in particular covering the rivalry between African American Joe Louis and the German Max Schmeling,
 which he and other writers portrayed as democracy and equality vs fascism. Davis saw sports as a way to break the color bar, and a way to reach out to a working class. During the Depression, Davis participated in the federal Works Progress Administration Writers' Project. 
In 1937 he received a Julius Rosenwald Fellowship.
Davis used his newspaper platform to call for integration of the sports world, and he began to engage himself with community organizing efforts, starting a Chicago labor newspaper, The Star, toward the end of World War II. 
The paper had a goal to "promote a policy of cooperation and unity between Russia and the United States" seeking to "[avoid] the red-baiting tendencies of the mainstream press." In 1947, the Spokane Daily Chronicle called the paper "a red weekly", saying that it "has most of the markings of a Communist front publication."
In 1945, Davis taught one of the first jazz history courses in the United States, at the Abraham Lincoln School in Chicago. In 1948, with the encouragement of authors such as Richard Wright and Margaret Walker, Davis published a collection of poems, entitled 47th Street: Poems. 
The collection chronicled the varied life on Chicago's South Side.[citation needed] Davis had been a strong supporter of the work of Richard Wright, calling his Uncle Tom's Children "the most absorbing fiction penned by a Negro since George Schuyler's Black No More [1931], 
but after Wright's break with the Left, Davis called Wright's public essays "an act of treason in the fight for our rights and aided only the racists who were constantly seeking any means to destroy cooperation between Reds and blacks."
Davis became one of the first promoters of the concept of a "raceless" society, based on his belief that race as a biological or social construct was illogical and a fallacy. Davis was a member of the Civil Rights Congress in 1947â€“1948, and was vice chair of the Chicago Civil Liberties Committee from 1944 to 1947.
 He was a supporter of Henry Wallace's Progressive Party. In his posthumously published memoir Livin' the Blues, Davis wrote of the period 1935 to 1948, "... I worked with all kinds of groups. 
I made no distinction between those labeled Communist, Socialist or merely liberal. My sole criterion was this: Are you with me in my determination to wipe out white supremacy?" Some libraries removed his books, and he became the subject of FBI investigations.
Davis began his career writing for African-American newspapers in Chicago. He moved to Atlanta, where he became the editor of the paper he turned into the Atlanta Daily World, then moved back to Chicago. 
During this time, he was outspoken about political and social issues, while also covering topics that ranged from sports to music. 
His poetry work was sponsored by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). He also played a role in the South Side Writers Group.
In the late 1940s, Davis moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he ran a small business. He also became involved in local labor issues, 
where his actions were tracked by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Davis died in 1987 in Hawaii.
