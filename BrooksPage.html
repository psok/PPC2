<h3>1917-2000</h3>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Gwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks was born in Topeka, Kansas, the first child of David Anderson Brooks and Keziah Wims. Her mother was a former school teacher who had chosen that field because she could not afford to attend medical school. 
(Family lore held that her paternal grandfather had escaped slavery to join Union forces during the American Civil War.)
When Brooks was six weeks old, her family moved to Chicago, Illinois during the Great Migration; from then on, Chicago was her hometown. She went by the nickname "Gwendie" among her close friends.
According to biographer Kenny Jackson Williams: "Brooks attended Hyde Park High School, the leading white high school in the city, 
but transferred to the all-black Wendell Phillips, then to the integrated Englewood High School. 
In 1936 she graduated from Wilson Junior College. 
These four schools gave her a perspective on racial dynamics in the city that continue[d] to influence her work.
Brooks published her first poem in a children's magazine at the age of thirteen.
 By the time she was sixteen, she had compiled a portfolio of around 75 published poems. 
 At seventeen, she started submitting her work to "Lights and Shadows", the poetry column of the Chicago Defender, an African-American newspaper. 
 Her poems, many published while she attended Wilson Junior College, ranged in style from traditional ballads and sonnets to poems using blues rhythms in free verse. 
 Her characters were often drawn from the poor of the inner city. After failing to obtain a position with the Chicago Defender, Brooks took a series of secretarial jobs.
By 1941, Brooks was taking part in poetry workshops. A particularly influential one was organized by Inez Cunningham Stark, an affluent white woman with a strong literary background. 
The group dynamic of Stark's workshop, all of whose participants were African American, energized Brooks. Her poetry began to be taken seriously. In 1943 she received an award for poetry from the Midwestern Writers' Conference.

Brooks' first book of poetry, A Street in Bronzeville (1945), published by Harper and Row, earned instant critical acclaim. 
She received her first Guggenheim Fellowship and was included as one of the “Ten Young Women of the Year” in Mademoiselle magazine. 
With her second book of poetry, Annie Allen (1950), she became the first African American to win the Pulitzer Prize for poetry; she also was awarded Poetry magazine’s Eunice Tietjens Prize.
After President John F. Kennedy invited Brooks to read at a Library of Congress poetry festival in 1962, she began a second career teaching creative writing. 
She taught at Columbia College Chicago, Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago State University, Elmhurst College, Columbia University, City College of New York, and the University of Wisconsin–Madison. 
In 1967 she attended a writers’ conference at Fisk University where, she said, she rediscovered her blackness.This rediscovery is reflected in her work In The Mecca (1968), a long poem about a mother searching for her lost child in a Chicago apartment building. 
In The Mecca was nominated for the National Book Award for poetry.
