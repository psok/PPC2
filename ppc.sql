(1, 1, 'Carl Sandburg', '1878', '1967', '<p>Gwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks was born on June 7, 1917, in Topeka, Kansas, the first child of David Anderson Brooks and Keziah Wims. Her mother was a former school teacher who had chosen that field because she could not afford to attend medical school. \r\n(Family lore held that her paternal grandfather had escaped slavery to join Union forces during the American Civil War.)\r\nWhen Brooks was six weeks old, her family moved to Chicago, Illinois during the Great Migration; from then on, Chicago was her hometown. She went by the nickname &ldquo;Gwendie&rdquo; among her close friends.\r\nAccording to biographer Kenny Jackson Williams: Brooks attended Hyde Park High School, the leading white high school in the city, \r\nbut transferred to the all-black Wendell Phillips, then to the integrated Englewood High School. \r\nIn 1936 she graduated from Wilson Junior College. \r\nThese four schools gave her a perspective on racial dynamics in the city that continue[d] to influence her work.[4]</p>\r\n<p>Brooks published her first poem in a children''s magazine at the age of thirteen. By the time she was sixteen, she had compiled a portfolio of around 75 published poems. At seventeen, she started submitting her work to &ldquo;Lights and Shadows&rdquo;, the poetry column of the Chicago Defender, an African-American newspaper. Her poems, many published while she attended Wilson Junior College, ranged in style from traditional ballads and sonnets to poems using blues rhythms in free verse. Her characters were often drawn from the poor of the inner city. After failing to obtain a position with the Chicago Defender, Brooks took a series of secretarial jobs.\r\n\r\nBy 1941, Brooks was taking part in poetry workshops. A particularly influential one was organized by Inez Cunningham Stark, an affluent white woman with a strong literary background. The group dynamic of Stark''s workshop, all of whose participants were African American, energized Brooks. Her poetry began to be taken seriously.[5] In 1943 she received an award for poetry from the Midwestern Writers'' Conference.\r\n\r\nBrooks'' first book of poetry, A Street in Bronzeville (1945), published by Harper and Row, earned instant critical acclaim. She received her first Guggenheim Fellowship and was included as one of the &ldquo;Ten Young Women of the Year&rdquo; in Mademoiselle magazine. With her second book of poetry, Annie Allen (1950), she became the first African American to win the Pulitzer Prize for poetry; she also was awarded Poetry magazine’s Eunice Tietjens Prize.\r\n\r\nAfter President John F. Kennedy invited Brooks to read at a Library of Congress poetry festival in 1962, she began a second career teaching creative writing. She taught at Columbia College Chicago, Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago State University, Elmhurst College, Columbia University, City College of New York,[6] and the University of Wisconsin–Madison. In 1967 she attended a writers’ conference at Fisk University where, she said, she rediscovered her blackness.[7] This rediscovery is reflected in her work In The Mecca (1968), a long poem about a mother searching for her lost child in a Chicago apartment building. In The Mecca was nominated for the National Book Award for poetry.\r\n\r\n</p>', 'Gwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks was born on June 7, 1917, in Topeka, Kansas, the first child of David Anderson Brooks and Keziah Wims...', 'Chicago', 'images/sandburg.jpg', ''),
(2, 2, 'Frank Marshall Davis', '1905', '1987', '<p>Frank Marshall Davis was an American journalist, poet, political and labor movement activist, and businessman. Davis was born in Arkansas City, Kansas, in 1905. His parents divorced, and Davis grew up living with his mother and stepfather and with his grandparents. In 1923, at age 17, Davis attended Friends University. From 1924 to 1927, and again in 1929, he attended Kansas State Agricultural College, now Kansas State University. When Davis entered Kansas State, there were twenty-five other African-American students enrolled there. He studied industrial journalism. He began to write poems as the result of a class assignment, and was encouraged to continue writing poetry by an English literature instructor. Davis pledged Phi Beta Sigma fraternity in 1925. He left college without getting a degree. In 1927 Davis moved to Chicago, where he worked variously for the Chicago Evening Bulletin, the Chicago Whip, and the Gary American, all African-American newspapers. He also wrote free-lance articles and short stories for African-American magazines. It was also during this time that Davis began a serious effort to write poetry, including his first long poem, entitled Chicago''s Congo, Sonata for an Orchestra. In 1931 Davis moved to Atlanta to become an editor of a twice-weekly paper. Later that year he became the paper''s managing editor. In 1932 the paper, renamed the Atlanta Daily World became the nation''s first successful black daily newspaper. Davis continued to write and publish poems, which came to the attention of Chicago socialite Frances Norton Manning. She introduced him to Norman Forgue, the publisher of Black Cat Press. In the summer of 1935, Forgue brought out Davis''s first book, Black Man''s Verse. In 1935, Davis moved back to Chicago to take the position of managing editor of the Associated Negro Press, a news service for black newspapers, which had begun in 1919. Eventually, Davis became executive editor for the ANP. He held the position until 1947. While in Chicago, Davis also started a photography club, worked for numerous political parties, and participated in the League of American Writers. Davis was an avid photographer, and inspired Richard Wright''s interest in the hobby. Davis''s wrote that his photography consisted in large part of nudes because "the female body fascinates me, both aesthetically and emotionally" and that when photographing, he focused on "contours" and the "wide range of tones". Davis, Richard Wright, Margaret Walker, and others were part of the South Side Writers Group, which met regularly beginning in 1936 to critique each other''s work. Davis worked as a sports reporter, in particular covering the rivalry between African American Joe Louis and the German Max Schmeling, which he and other writers portrayed as democracy and equality vs fascism. Davis saw sports as a way to break the color bar, and a way to reach out to a working class. During the Depression, Davis participated in the federal Works Progress Administration Writers'' Project. In 1937 he received a Julius Rosenwald Fellowship. Davis used his newspaper platform to call for integration of the sports world, and he began to engage himself with community organizing efforts, starting a Chicago labor newspaper, The Star, toward the end of World War II. The paper had a goal to "promote a policy of cooperation and unity between Russia and the United States" seeking to "[avoid] the red-baiting tendencies of the mainstream press." In 1947, the Spokane Daily Chronicle called the paper "a red weekly", saying that it "has most of the markings of a Communist front publication." In 1945, Davis taught one of the first jazz history courses in the United States, at the Abraham Lincoln School in Chicago. In 1948, with the encouragement of authors such as Richard Wright and Margaret Walker, Davis published a collection of poems, entitled 47th Street: Poems. The collection chronicled the varied life on Chicago''s South Side.[citation needed] Davis had been a strong supporter of the work of Richard Wright, calling his Uncle Tom''s Children "the most absorbing fiction penned by a Negro since George Schuyler''s Black No More [1931], but after Wright''s break with the Left, Davis called Wright''s public essays "an act of treason in the fight for our rights and aided only the racists who were constantly seeking any means to destroy cooperation between Reds and blacks." Davis became one of the first promoters of the concept of a "raceless" society, based on his belief that race as a biological or social construct was illogical and a fallacy. Davis was a member of the Civil Rights Congress in 1947–1948, and was vice chair of the Chicago Civil Liberties Committee from 1944 to 1947. He was a supporter of Henry Wallace''s Progressive Party. In his posthumously published memoir Livin'' the Blues, Davis wrote of the period 1935 to 1948, "... I worked with all kinds of groups. I made no distinction between those labeled Communist, Socialist or merely liberal. My sole criterion was this: Are you with me in my determination to wipe out white supremacy?" Some libraries removed his books, and he became the subject of FBI investigations. Davis began his career writing for African-American newspapers in Chicago. He moved to Atlanta, where he became the editor of the paper he turned into the Atlanta Daily World, then moved back to Chicago. During this time, he was outspoken about political and social issues, while also covering topics that ranged from sports to music. His poetry work was sponsored by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). He also played a role in the South Side Writers Group. In the late 1940s, Davis moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he ran a small business. He also became involved in local labor issues, where his actions were tracked by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Davis died in 1987 in Hawaii.\r\n\r\nSource: "Frank Marshall Davis."

(3, 3, 'Marge Piercy', '1936', NULL, '<p>Marge Piercy is an American poet, novelist, and social activist.\r\n She is the author of the New York Times bestseller Gone to Soldiers, a sweeping historical novel set during World War II.\r\n Piercy was born in Detroit, Michigan, to a family deeply affected by the Great Depression. She was the first in her family to attend college, studying at the University of Michigan.\r\n Winning a Hopwood Award for Poetry and Fiction (1957) enabled her to finish college and spend some time in France, and her formal schooling ended with an M.A. from Northwestern University.\r\nHer first book of poems, Breaking Camp, was published in 1968.\r\nAn indifferent student in her early years, Piercy developed a love of books when she came down with rheumatic fever in her mid-childhood and could do little but read. \r\n"It taught me that there''s a different world there, that there were all these horizons that were quite different from what I could see," she said in a 1984 interview.\r\nAs of 2013, she is author of seventeen volumes of poems, among them The Moon is Always Female (1980, considered a feminist classic) and The Art of Blessing the Day (1999), as well as fifteen novels, one play (The Last White Class, co-authored with her third and current husband Ira Wood), one collection of essays\r\n (Parti-colored Blocks for a Quilt), one non-fiction book, and one memoir.\r\nHer novels and poetry often focus on feminist or social concerns, although her settings vary.\r\n While Body of Glass (published in the US as He, She and It) is a science fiction novel that won the Arthur C. Clarke Award, City of Darkness, City of Light is set during the French Revolution. Other of her novels, such as Summer People and The Longings of Women are set during the modern day.\r\n  All of her books share a focus on women''s lives.\r\nWoman on the Edge of Time (1976) mixes a time travel story with issues of social justice, feminism, and the treatment of the mentally ill. \r\nThis novel is considered a classic of utopian "speculative" science fiction as well as a feminist classic. William Gibson has credited Woman on the Edge of Time as the birthplace of Cyberpunk. Piercy tells this in an introduction to Body of Glass. Body of Glass (He, She and It) (1991) postulates an environmentally ruined world dominated by sprawling mega-cities and a futuristic version of the Internet, \r\nthrough which Piercy weaves elements of Jewish mysticism and the legend of the Golem, although a key story element is the main character''s attempts to regain custody of her young son.\r\nMany of Piercy''s novels tell their stories from the viewpoints of multiple characters, often including a first-person voice among numerous third-person narratives. \r\nHer World War II historical novel, Gone To Soldiers (1987) follows the lives of nine major characters in the United States, Europe and Asia. The first-person account in Gone To Soldiers is the diary of French teenager Jacqueline Levy-Monot, who is also followed in a third-person account after her capture by the Nazis.\r\nPiercy''s poetry tends to be highly personal free verse and often addresses the same concern with feminist and social issues. \r\nHer work shows commitment to the dream of social change (what she might call, in Judaic terms, tikkun olam, or the repair of the world), rooted in story, the wheel of the Jewish year, and a range of landscapes and settings.\r\nShe lives in Wellfleet on Cape Cod, Massachusetts with her husband, Ira Wood.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Source: "Marge Piercy." <em>Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia</em>.
